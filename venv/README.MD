The description of the module and the information on the map. This program parses the file getting all the necessary information about films such as their name, year when they were released and the location. The user enters two parameters at the very beginning of the program including the year one is interested in and the color of the markers which will appear on the map. Then the module geopy is used to get the longitude and latitude of the location where movies were filmed. Using imported module folium, we make three layers on the map. The first one is just a map, the second layer consists of names, and the third contains location markers which will appear at the exact coordinates provided by geopy module. The created layer control makes the interface more comfortable as the user can switch the layer by putting a tick after one or both of two categories: "names" and "locations." It is important also to add that the file from which we get the information should appear in the same folder where the program is. What is more, the map will also be created in this particular folder and saved as an HTML file.
